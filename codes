To enable a a service:

# systemctl enable <servicename>
# systemctl start <servicename>
 
To disable a service:

# systemctl stop <servicename>
# systemctl disable <servicename>

Other common and familiar actions are restart, reload, and status.
# systemctl restart <servicename>
# systemctl reload <servicename>
# systemctl status <servicename>

NOTE: Apparently, only the use of "status" will output to terminal.  All others will take effect silently. 

Getting a list of available services which are enabled and diabled can be done with the command:

# systemctl list-unit-files --type=service

 Systemd uses and manages "units."  These "units" can be services, devices, sockets, or mount points.   The type of unit is identified by .service, .device, .socket, or .mount.

 
To view failed units on a system:
# systemctl --failed


An interesting feature of systemd is that you can view how long each process took to start:
# systemd-analyze blame
