## LINUX - LVM Resizing
NOTE:  Do not run on systems running OS older than RH5.6.

Be VERY careful with your syntax when using the lvresize command as you could easily reduce your filesystem to a size smaller than its current usage.
* The lvresize command can extend or reduce a filesystem.
* If there is space available to extend a filesystem, you can extend without unmounting the volume.
* Common switches used are '-r' and '-L'.  Please check the man page for additional switches and information.
 
**Some examples to extend a volume:**
To extend a filesystem that is smaller than 8G to 8G,
     lvresize -r -L 8G /dev/mapper/vgxxxx-lvxxxx

To add an additional 8G to a filesystem, add a '+' to the front of the 8,
     lvresize -r -L +8G /dev/mapper/vgxxxx-lvxxxx

To reduce a volume, umount the filesystem and run a preliminary fsck on it prior to the reduce.
     # umount /mount/point
     # fsck.ext3 -f -y /dev/mapper/vgxxxx-lvxxxx  (if ext3)

NOTE:  Be sure you are not reducing the filesystem to a size smaller than the current data stored or all data will be lost.
* The command will be similar to the extend command, but using a '-' instead of a '+'.
* To reduce a 6.5G filesystem to 6G in size, essentially reducing by 512M

# lvresize -r -L -512M /dev/mapper/vgxxxx-lvxxxx
Another way this could be completed with the same result of going from 6.5G to 6G
# lvresize -r -L 6G /dev/mapper/vgxxxx-lvxxxx
Remount the volume either manually or with mount -a

On older than RH 5.6, use lvextend or lvreduce.
# lvextend -L +35G /dev/mapper/vgxxxx-lvxxxx

then resize with:
     # resize2fs /dev/mapper/vgxxxx-lvxxxx

Linux LVM add swap

**Create swap space**
sudo lvcreate -L 8G -n lvswap vgroot
sudo mkswap /dev/mapper/vgroot-lvswap

**Add to /etc/fstab**
blkid
sudo vi /etc/fstab

**Add swap to server**
sudo mount -a
sudo swapon -a
