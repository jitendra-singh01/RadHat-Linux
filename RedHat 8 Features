Software management
The software is now managed by the new version of YUM which is based on DNF in Fedora. This new version has similar syntax and compatible with the previous version YUM v3 (RHEL 7).

The new version provides increased performance, support for modular content and stable APU for integration with tooling.

On RHEL 7, RPM utility verifies payload content of individual files while unpacking which leads to serious issues as if the payload is damaged, it is only validated after executing script actions, which are irreversible.

On RHEL 8, RPM command validates the entire package before installation using the hash.
