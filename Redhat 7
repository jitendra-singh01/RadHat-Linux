Journal
The Journal is a component of systemd that is responsible for viewing and management of log files. It can be used in parallel, or in place of a traditional syslog daemon, such as rsyslogd. The Journal was developed to address problems connected with traditional logging. It is closely integrated with the rest of the system, supports various logging technologies and access management for the log files. For more information, see this RedHat article

Few basic commands:
view all entries in system journal since last boot - 'journalctl -ab'
live view mode, monitor logs as they come in - 'journalctl -f'
restart journald daemon - 'systemctl restart systemd-journald'
RHEL7 kernel management
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is distributed with the GNU GRand Unified Boot loader (GRUB) version 2 boot loader, which allows the user to select an operating system or kernel to be loaded at system boot time. GRUB 2 also allows the user to pass arguments to the kernel. ‚Å† GRUB 2 reads its configuration from the /boot/grub2/grub.cfg file. This file contains menu information. - DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE MANUALLY!!!

grub.cfg is generated by invoking the /usr/sbin/grub2-mkconfig utility, and is automatically updated by grubby each time a new kernel is installed. When regenerated manually using grub2-mkconfig, the file is generated according to the template files located in /etc/grub.d/, and custom settings in the /etc/default/grub file. Edits of grub.cfg will be lost any time grub2-mkconfig is used to regenerate the file, so care must be taken to reflect any manual changes in /etc/default/grub as well.

to make changes to default kernel entry, edit kernel parameters in /etc/default/grub. Once changes are made, run 'grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg' to update the grub.cfg
to make changes to ALTBOOT entrly, edit /etc/grub.d/40_custom. Make sure to preserve #VZaltboot comment lines surrounding entries, as they are used to determine the VZaltboot specific code
to see your default boot entry, run "grubby --info=DEFAULT"
to see all entries, run "grubby --info=ALL"
to re-install grub into your boot disk, run "/sbin/grub2-install /dev/sda"
Systemd
Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. It is designed to be backwards compatible with SysV init scripts, and provides a number of features such as parallel startup of system services at boot time, on-demand activation of daemons, support for system state snapshots, or dependency-based service control logic. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, systemd replaces Upstart as the default init system. For more information, see overview of systemd, and also RedHat documentation on systemd.

Few basic commands:

list all currently loaded service units - 'systemctl list-units --type service'
list all loaded units regardless of their state - 'systemctl list-units --type service --all'
list all available service units to see if they are enabled - 'systemctl list-unit-files --type service'
verify that a particular service unit is running - 'systemctl is-active name.service'
determine whether a particular service unit is enabled - 'systemctl is-enabled name.service'
start/stop/restart service - 'systemctl start/stop/restart name.service'
